        <p>Known as "the First Spring in the Desert”, Crescent Spring is located at the foot of the Singing Sand Mountains. It is nearly 100 meters long from north to south, and about 25 meters wide from east to west. It is so named because its shape looks like a crescent moon. It is the quintessential oasis.
        </p>
        <p>Crescent Spring is always visited together with the Singing Sand Mountains, and the best time to visit is at dusk when the sun is setting slowly over the dunes, bathing them in pink and gold and casting long shadows.
